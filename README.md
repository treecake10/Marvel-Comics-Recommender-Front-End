This is a web application employing the Marvel API in which a user can create their profile and like/favorite any Marvel character, series, events or creators. This can be done by clicking on the 'Explore' tab taking users to a new page where they can use search filtering to find a character/comic/event/creator they want to like or favorite. These prefrences are stored in a database, and users get a personalized list of recommended comics, events, or series in return. The plan is to use Java Springboot for the backend and make SQL queries on datasets to make recommendations based each user's preference(s).
